<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  This simulator was created to allow students to experiment with Python EV3DEV, even without an actual EV3 available.
  When using this simulator, keep in mind that the robot behaviour will not be identical to a real robot; the simulated robot...
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>...doesn't have backlash</li>
    <li>...always starts and stops instantly</li>
    <li>...never skids</li>
    <li>...don't collide with walls or objects</li>
    <li>...motors and sensors are perfectly accurate and balanced</li>
</ul>
<p>It's good enough for practice and planning, but don't expect the program to work identically on a real robot;
you'll probably need to do a lot of tuning and adjustments.</p>
