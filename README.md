Browser based simulator for ev3dev-lang-python
===

This simulator was created to allow students to experiment with Python
EV3DEV, even without an actual EV3 available.

Installation
---

The simulator is meant to be served through a webserver.
Download all files and put them in a directory on your server and that should be it.
Due to CORS protection on web browsers, it will not work when served from a "file://" URL.
